# Unit tests

These are NOT the standard tests provided by [PlatformIO].  These tests can be run
from anywhere and are not device specific.  To run them you will though need 
[cmake] to be installed and accessible from the command line.  The test framework used is [Catch2].

## To run these tests

  - Install [cmake] and make it accessible from the command line. (I used the windows 10 installer and checked add cmake to the path variable for the current user).
  - Install Catch2
